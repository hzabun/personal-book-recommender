# Personal book recommender

A single book can drastically change your life.

But finding the next book to read can be very challenging. We have to be careful not to judge a book by its cover. At the same time, giving every single book a chance can be quick wasteful in terms of time.

That's why this project aims to create a personal book recommender based on several different algorithms.

The tracking and logging for each algorithm is done via [MLflow](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow).
